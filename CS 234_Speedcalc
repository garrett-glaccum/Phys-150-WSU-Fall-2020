/**
 * Class Name: Speedcalc
 * @author Garrett Glaccum, 9/7/2020
 * Problem Description: Create a Java application that can be used to calculate the speed of a specific object in both meters per seconds 
 * 						and kilometers per hour. The user will input the desired distance in meters and the desired time in seconds and 
 * 						the program will output the m/s and km/h.
 * Goals: The user will input their desired distance and time
 * 			The program will calculate the speed of the object based on the given values
 * 			The program will output each speed in its individual formats accurately
 * Inputs: Distance; Time
 * Outputs: Speed in m/s; Speed in km/h
 * Java Packages: Java.util.Scanner
 * Input and outputs screen format: 
 * 		"Enter distance traveled in meters:"
 *		"Enter amount of time in seconds:"
 * 		"The Speed traveled in meters per second is:"
 *		"The Speed traveled in kilometers per hour is:"
 * Test-Suite:
 * 		distance = 1000 meters, time = 3600 seconds => m/s = 0.2777778 m/s, km/h = 1
 * Pseudocode: (main)
 * 		- create and instance of the Speedcalc
 * 		- call the readInput() method to read the distance and time
 * 		- call the getDistance()
 * 		- call the getTime()
